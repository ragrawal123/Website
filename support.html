		<p>
			1. Do Your Research: It is extremely important to do research because these projects are hard, and even professional developers use the Internet, so make sure to look stuff up to get a better understanding of what you are doing. <br>
			2. Don't Wait Until The Last Minute: The projects take a really long time. Do not wait until the weekend before to finish it, do bits by bits of it as time goes on and you will thank yourself for doing it gradually rather than spending 8-12 hours over the weekend.<br>
			3. Work With Friends: The projects can be very draining, especially for one person to do. We recommend that you work with your friends because the projects then become fun and engaging, and you can also discuss more ideas together and code better. You don't have to work with other people, but it's a lot easier to do so.

			<be>We are the team that built this website. I, Raunak, am on the first picture, and to my right it goes Rishi, Eric, and then Amay. Ultimately, we came up with this idea to make the ATCS Guide because we wanted future students to have easy access to resources that we wish we had easy access to. Everything that we did right and wrong in our time in the class was thought of as we put hours into designing this website. We hope that all users will find this helpful and can use this website in a time of need. To reflect, overall learning HTML and CSS was pretty hard. The syntax itself is really easy, but the positioning and creating the website we imagined proved to be a lot more difficult than we thought. So, I guess we are still learning not to underestimate coding and appreciate all the websites we see. Hope you enjoyed our guide to ATCS!
