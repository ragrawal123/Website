		<p>For Mac, there is no need to install anything else to run your programs on. Terminal is already installed for you and you can use that to run your programs. The steps for running a program in Terminal are 
			<br>1. Open Terminal. <br> 
			2.<code class = "code"> cd</code> into your Github repository containing your program file[Github stuff down below].<br>
			3.<code> ls</code> to make sure your program is in the repository (doesn't need to be done all the time). <br>
			4. Run the program using <code>python3 programName.py</code>

		<p>
			Windows is a bit more complicated. It doesn't inherently have a nice system to run on like Terminal, but we can install one. Here we are going to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux. First what we want to do is install the Linux subsystem. The steps to do so can be found on the Microsoft Docs: <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" id = "link">Install WSL.</a> We recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 when it prompts you to choose an app to run the subsystem on from the Microsoft Store. 
			<br><br>Once you are done installing, you will need to open the Ubuntu app up and create a username or password. Keep in mind that when typing in the password it doesn't show anything, but the characters are there so be mindful. Once done, you should be able to <code>cd</code> into your desired directory and run the program using <code>python3 programName.py</code>. Again, to check whether the program is in the directory you can do <code>ls.</code>
