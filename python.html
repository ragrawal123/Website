			Python is a high-level programming language that is very popular today for software engineers to use. The reason it's so popular is because Python is simple. It has simple syntax which makes it easy for developers to use. Furthermore, Python proves to have increased productivity compared to other languages because of its built in debugger, so it allows developers to go through the edit-test-debug cycle a lot faster and develop their products faster.

			Since we covered Python in the course, we didn't have to do the same on-our-own-time learninng that we did for HTML/CSS. However, the projects we had proved to be difficult at times because there was useful syntax we didn't know about, so having these documentation and support sources below really helped us out: <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://docs.python.org/3/">Official Python Documentation</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules">Useful Modules and Libraries</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "http://www.akyokus.com/fall2019/ip/lectures/Lecture1.1-WelcomeToPython-full.pdf">Python Notes-Long Slideshow</a> <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/">GeeksforGeeks-Python</a><br>
				The sources above range from the official documentation of Python, which we find pretty hard to understand sometimes to a tutorial from GeeksforGeeks. If you're just looking for an explanation of something, we recommend using the official documentation and the libraries. But, if you're looking to learn how something works, we recommend using the GeeksforGeeks link. The slideshow is just an introduction to what Python is and some basic terms.

			These sources below are meant to help test you to see if you understand some basics of Python before you go through more advanced topics. Most likely, you will be covering a good amount of advanced Python in class, so these are just to help you with the basics so that you have a good foundation of Python for the class: <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">W3Schools-Python</a>-[Exercises are near the bottom of the navigation column.]<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.practicepython.org/">PracticePython</a><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/">W3Resource Exercises</a><br>
			Python can get increasingly difficult very fast. But having a good foundation can help a lot when doing problem sets for the class, so all the sources above will definitely help you as you move through the ATCS class.
