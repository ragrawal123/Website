			HTML is the language that software engineers use to develop webpages. It serves as the base for the mechanics of the page, such as the links you see or the navbar above. HTML helps develop just pure text, and it can also be used to create user interfaces for desktop apps like Spotify. In fact, as you probably already know, this entire website was a prokect that my group did to learn HTML. If you right click and view the page source, you can see the HTML code for all the pages.

			CSS is a helper language that software engineers use to design webpages. It serves as the language that would create the design of the webpage. So all the positioning and colors and font you see on this webpage and others too is mostly the work of CSS. Like HTML, it can also be used to create user interfaces for desktop apps like Spotify.

			HTML can be hard, though not as difficult as CSS in my opinion. So, having some resources at your disposal any time can be very useful when learning HTML or trying to code it. Here are some sources that I found useful when coding the website: <br>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://learn.shayhowe.com/">Learn ShayHowe HTML</a>
