				<div id = "text1"><p>The Advanced Topics Computer Science class is a course that challenges students to think and develop their compsci skills on their own and put them to the test with difficult projects. With support from the teacher, students can collaborate to learn skills like Python or SQL and create projects such as an encryption process or a shell. By working on their own or in groups, students ultimately will learn how to do research to learn new compsci topics and then implement that in their coding projects to learn what real software development is like.</p></div>

				<div id = "text2"><p>Mr. Redmond is an alumni of Menlo School who now teaches AT Math and AT Computer Science. He came to Menlo with a background in software engineering and data science, working in the industry at Airbnb, Strava, and Google X. He enjoys competitive gaming(board-, card-, and video-) as well as puzzles and riddles. A master at MTG and WOW, Mr. Redmond loves to teach and bond with students over computer science and games.</p></div>

				<div id = "title3"><h2>Student Experience:</h2></div>
				<div id = "text3"><p>My name is Max and I am a junior at Menlo. I have taken both Intro to Comp Sci and Ap Comp Sci before taking AT Comp Sci with Mr. Redmond. This class has been so different from my other comp sci classes, for it is such a more of a relaxed curriculum with room for change, unlike rigorous AP classes. We are able to have more of a voice in this class, as Mr. Redmond frequently asks us what would be fun to learn. It has been really fun getting to know Mr. Redmond and learning about topics in Comp Sci I have never had exposure to before. The class taught me two big things. One, we need to do our research and endure learning different concepts in order to do our projects. Second, computer science involves a lot of not knowing how to do something, but you take the time to read and understand how to do things.</p></div>
