			We just recently covered SQL, its not something that a class would cover for the entire year but it is still plently useful for data science researchers and developers. SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is used to communicate with a database. SQL queries(statements) can be used to update a database or mostly in our case, retrieve data from a database using the <code>SELECT</code> statement. The syntax for the language seems to be relatively simple, but the hard part about SQL is thinking of what you need to do to pull data off the database. Also remember that we covered beginner topics mostly.

			The first step in being able to code in SQL is obviously checking if you have it installed. If you already have python3 installed, which you most likely do, then you should also have sqlite3 installed. Check if you have it installed by running <code>sqlite3</code> in your [Terminal or WSL]. If you don't have it installed, follow the steps <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/">here</a> to do so.

			You can run SQL on either your Terminal or WSL, so there's no need to worry about installing those. But if you haven't installed, then look at the <a target="_blank" id = "link" href="getting-started.html" > Getting Started</a> page to do so. Once in your designated shell, you can run sqlite in two different ways. One, you can run <code>sqlite3</code> and then just input your code directly into the line, or two you can use a text editor and create a program file and then run that as a query. More information on that <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://sqlite.org/cli.html">here</a>.

			Before looking at some exercises, here are some useful sources that will be helpful when coding in SQL: <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/sql.html">Official SQL Documentation</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">W3Schools-SQL</a><br>

			Below are multiple sources that you can use to start coding in SQL, but the slideshow personally made by Mr. Redmond and the dataquest link go hand in hand. We recommend going through the dataquest and the most of the slides to start learning on SQL:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1umcVIJdkeRf6cswwyk74BUm2o_-TN0PbuZ-wLPz3GWA/edit?usp=sharing">Mr. Redmond's Slideshow</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.dataquest.io/blog/sql-basics/">DataQuest-SQL</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql">CodeAcademy-SQL</a><br>
			The W3Schools SQL resource above also has some exercises and it can act as a tutorial too, so you can use that too along with CodeAcademy. The great part about SQL is that you can visualize a lot of the stuff you are doing, and the mechanics that we learned were more or less straightforward, so this is a nice language to learn for the future.
