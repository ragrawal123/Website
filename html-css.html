			HTML is the language that software engineers use to develop webpages. It serves as the base for the mechanics of the page, such as the links you see or the navbar above. HTML helps develop just pure text, and it can also be used to create user interfaces for desktop apps like Spotify. In fact, as you probably already know, this entire website was a prokect that my group did to learn HTML. If you right click and view the page source, you can see the HTML code for all the pages.

			CSS is a helper language that software engineers use to design webpages. It serves as the language that would create the design of the webpage. So all the positioning and colors and font you see on this webpage and others too is mostly the work of CSS. Like HTML, it can also be used to create user interfaces for desktop apps like Spotify.

			HTML can be hard, though not as difficult as CSS in my opinion. So, having some resources at your disposal any time can be very useful when learning HTML or trying to code it. Here are some sources that I found useful when coding the website: <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools HTML</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://learn.shayhowe.com/">Learn ShayHowe HTML</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a><br>
			The upper three links are sources that we read to start learning the basics of HTML as well as a reference sheet, to look at different HTML tags and see what they do and how they work. The W3Schools site is especially good to act as a HTML documentation site while the Mimo app on our phones was useful to learn some of the basics of HTML.

			CSS was the hardest part of designing this website. Making sure that every text or heading or link is positioned correctly did make us frustrated at times. But, we had some documentations and sources below that we found useful:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">W3Schools CSS</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.onblastblog.com/css3-cheat-sheet/">CSS Cheat Sheet</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a target="_blank" id = "link" href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a><br>
			When starting to learn CSS, we mostly used the Mimo app on my phone to learn the basics, but we found it slow and not that helpful. So we turned to W3Schools for documentation and the CSS Cheat Sheet for tips. Another hard part about this was designing the website out of thin air and coding it. To get an idea of what we wanted the website to look like, we used <a target="_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> to design the website and then code from there.

			To get started on learning the basics of HTML and CSS, we'd recommend: <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3School</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">CodeAcademy-HTML</a><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <a target = "_blank" id = "link" href = "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css">CodeAcademy-CSS</a><br>
			All these sites are good for learning HTML and CSS, and they also provide exercises for you to go through to test your knowledge on HTML and CSS. However, the best practice comes from trying to make a webpage like we did, so once you feel comfortable try making a webpage! It will require a lot of trial and error and more research, but that's the purpose of the ATCS class.
